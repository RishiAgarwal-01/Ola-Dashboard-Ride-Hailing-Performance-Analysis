# Ola-Dashboard-Ride-Hailing-Performance-Analysis

Analyzing and visualizing ride-hailing performance data to uncover key operational trends, success rates, cancellation drivers, and payment behaviors to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency.

## üéØ Problem Statement & Context

The goal of this project was to provide a comprehensive, data-driven view of ride-hailing operations to monitor performance and identify areas for strategic improvement. This involved transforming raw, transactional ride data into actionable business intelligence.

**Key Analytical Focus Areas:**

1.  **Operational Metrics:** Tracking total bookings (39K+), success rates (62%), and revenue trends (‚Çπ14M).
2.  **Efficiency:** Deep diving into the root causes of the **~28% cancellation rate** (driver vs. customer driven).
3.  **Customer Experience:** Analyzing customer and driver ratings for satisfaction trends (~4.0/5).
4.  **Payment Trends:** Assessing the adoption of various payment modes (UPI, Cards, Cash).

## üß† Approach & Methodology

### Data Preparation & Automation
* Used **SQL** to extract and structure the raw ride-hailing transactional data.
* Leveraged **Excel** to perform robust data cleaning, transformation, and validation, ensuring data quality for analysis.
* Automated the data pipeline using Python scripts for easy refresh and scaling of the dashboard.

### Data Modeling & KPI Development
* Constructed an optimized data model within Power BI.
* Developed key **DAX measures** to calculate core business KPIs:
    * Total Bookings, Booking Value (**‚Çπ14M**).
    * Ride Success Rate (**62%**) and Cancellation Rate (**~28%**).
    * Segmentation by payment mode, ride type, and customer/driver ratings.

### Dashboard Design & Storytelling
* Designed an interactive, multi-page **Power BI Dashboard** focused on operational clarity.
* Included visuals that clearly segment metrics by time, region, and segment (e.g., separating customer vs. driver cancellations).
* Applied dashboard design best practices for ease of use for operational stakeholders.

### Insights & Impact
* Analyzed **39K+ bookings** to provide a clear performance snapshot.
* Provided strategies to mitigate cancellation drivers and capitalize on digital payment adoption.
* Offered data-backed recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction (based on the ~4.0/5 rating) and operational efficiency.
